## 🧭 Overview

Unlike traditional trainers, **YAPYAP** uses a **multi-threaded overlay architecture**, meaning it doesn’t modify the game’s memory. It works purely as a visualization layer — tracking motion data, environment feedback, and in-game metrics with high performance and low GPU load.

Perfect for titles running DirectX 11–12 or Vulkan, YAPYAP adapts dynamically to your current session, letting you save and apply your personal presets instantly.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* **👁 Visual Overlay Engine:** Create clean ESP-like outlines, radar grids, and HUD layers.
* **🎯 Precision Lock System:** Adjustable aim-curves and FOV logic for performance analysis.
* **📡 Radar & Awareness Module:** Monitor targets, terrain angles, and elevation data.
* **🧩 Config Profiles:** Save and export `.yapcfg` setups across multiple games.
* **💨 Dynamic Injection:** Attaches automatically with low CPU overhead and instant recovery.
* **🎛 Overlay Editor:** Drag, resize, and recolor HUD elements directly in-game.
* **💾 Hot Reload:** Modify configs live without restarting the session.

[!IMPORTANT]
YAPYAP never alters in-game memory. It’s a pure overlay system — safe, reversible, and compatible with DirectX 11/12 and Vulkan rendering.
